I am currently a 3rd year Ph. D. candidate at Department of Computing, [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), advised by my insightful supervisor [Prof. Yuanqing Zheng](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csyqzheng/). I received B.E. degree in Communication Engineering from School of Information and Communication Engineering, [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/). My research interests include Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN), LoRa, Mobile Sensing.

Please find more about me in my [CV](files/CV_Shiming.pdf).
